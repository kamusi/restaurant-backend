# Menus

This is the backend of the menu app. 

## Build & development

- `npm install` to install dependencies 
- Move the content of the `dist` folder generated by the front-end build in the `public` folder.
- `npm start` to launch the server. Note that you need a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) server running.
